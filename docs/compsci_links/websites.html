            At some point you'll want to set up your own webpage. In any case, a simple tool to get started is by hosting it through <a href="http://romantsegelskyi.github.io/blog/2015/07/26/personal-page-blog/">GitHub Pages</a>. I've had a great experience with it, even though I haven't used a lot of its functionalities since I brought my own template.
