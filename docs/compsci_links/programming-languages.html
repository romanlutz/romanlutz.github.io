            Depending on your situation, you may or may not have the luxury to take a structured approach to learning a new language. There's a few great books that introduce you to the basics and teach your programming in general. Those aren't even that hard to find. The books I list below go beyond the very basics, although they may include some important fundamentals.

                <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033707.do">Effective Modern C++</a> by Scott Meyers is arguably the most useful book on programming I have ever read. I studied it while learning C++ basics, and could literally see the quality of my code improving. Conversations quickly moved from "how to somehow get the job done" to "how to get the job done properly", without wasting any time. If you want to get the book, be careful, though! There's a few similarly named titles (all by Scott Meyers), from "Effective Modern C++", and "Effective C++" to "More Effective C++". The most recent version is probably the way to go.

                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997">Effective Java</a> by Joshua Bloch serves a very similar purpose to Java as Effective Modern C++ to C++. I love that the book contains lots of puzzles that will undoubtedly cost you many nights of sleep. I cannot overstate the effect the "Concurrency" chapter has had on my thought process when developing concurrent applications, regardless of the language.

            Then, of course, there's these tools you run into that make life a lot easier. Below is a fairly random list:

                <a href="https://github.com/google/python-fire?utm_source=mybridge&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=read_more">Python Fire</a> automatically generates CLIs for your functions.
