                The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/category/podcast/">Microsoft Research Podcast</a> is pretty interesting, because you rarely get researchers talking about their journey.

                <a href="https://mastersofscale.com">Masters of Scale</a> by Reid Hoffman does a great job at conveying a message while telling a story in a compelling and entertaining way. Plus, the guests alone are worth tuning in, with Sheryl Sandberg and Reed Hastings to name a few.

        ... and if we dare go beyond tech-focused podcasts, there's a ton of other interesting ones!
        <ul>
            <li>
                In <a href="https://www.ted.com/read/ted-podcasts/worklife">Worklife</a> Adam Grant talks about companies that make their workplace special in order to foster creativity, encourage criticism, and support a healthy work-life balance. Extremely thought-provoking, and definitely time well spent.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="http://freakonomics.com">Freakonomics Radio</a> by Steven J. Dubner is probably my favorite podcast on economics for exploring the "hidden side of everything". Remarkably, they manage to give all sides of any given discussion some time to represent their viewpoint.
