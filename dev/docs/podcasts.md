# Podcasts

Let's start with the tech/software/data related podcasts:

- The [Radical AI Podcast](https://www.radicalai.org/) regularly hosts people from the Responsible AI space. They really embrace the idea that Responsible (or Radical) AI is not possible without diversity of perspectives, fields, etc. and they have been very successful in attracting fantastic speakers (every episode I have listened to so far would have been an absolute highlight on any podcast). Plus, the hosts Dylan and Jess guide the interviews really well and give the guests a lot of space to express their thoughts (which is refreshing compared to other more host-centric podcasts).
- The [Microsoft Research Podcast](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/category/podcast/) is pretty interesting, because you otherwise only rarely get researchers talking about their journey on podcasts.
- [Packet Pushers - Datanauts](http://packetpushers.net/series/datanauts-podcast/) mostly focuses on infrastructure (cloud networking, storage, compute, etc.)
- [PodCtl](https://blog.openshift.com/tag/podctl/) covers the latest in the Kubernetes ecosystem.
- Various O'Reilly podcasts such as
    - [O'Reilly Data Show](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/oreilly-data-show-podcast)
    - [O'Reilly Programming](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/oreilly-programming-podcast)
    - [O'Reilly Radar](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/oreilly-radar-podcast) covers emerging technologies
- [Hanselminutes](https://hanselminutes.com/) by Scott Hanselman covers a very diverse set of topics related to technology.
- [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) has been growing in popularity. It's great if you want to get an idea of a field, say web development, or caching in distributed systems, you name it.

... and if we dare go beyond tech-focused podcasts, there's a ton of other interesting ones!
