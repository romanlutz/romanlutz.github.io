## Websites

Let's start with some interesting websites to read or check regularly if you're interested in Computer Science:

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) is a great resource for all kinds of news related to technology. They have a weekly newsletter that sends a digest of interesting links. This is an email I look forward to every single week. Great stuff!
- Itamar Turner-Trauring from [Code Without Rules](https://codewithoutrules.com) has some interesting thoughts on the work of a software engineer, priorities, and many mistakes to avoid. Whether or not you agree with him, he brings a refreshing perspective and frankness to many topics. [This article](https://codewithoutrules.com/2017/09/18/when-startups-pay-less/) is a typical example.
- [Medium](https://medium.com) is a platform for all kinds of articles, with authors ranging from real journalists to hobby writers.
- [OpenSource.com](http://opensource.com/) has a few interesting articles related to - you guessed it - open source.

Tech company blogs have high quality standards, so it's worth checking them every so often.

- [Lyft Engineering Blog](https://eng.lyft.com)
- [Uber Engineering Blog](https://eng.uber.com)
- [Netflix Tech Blog](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog)
- [AirBnB Engineering and Data Science](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering)
- [Azure Machine Learning Blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/tag/azure-machine-learning/)
- [Google Research Blog](https://research.googleblog.com)
- [Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/)
- I found [this nice article](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/geospatial-analysis-python-geojson-geopandas.html) about geospatial analysis on the Twilio blog.
- [Hakka Labs](https://www.hakkalabs.co/) is a community for Data Engineers.
- [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io) has lots of broadly data science related articles, e.g. [this one](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots/) on data visualization.

At some point you'll want to set up your own webpage. In any case, a simple tool to get started is by hosting it through [GitHub Pages](http://romantsegelskyi.github.io/blog/2015/07/26/personal-page-blog/). I've had a great experience with it, even though I haven't used a lot of its functionalities since I brought my own template. I created a few backgrounds using [cool-backgrounds.io](https://coolbackgrounds.io/), some of which are featured on this webpage.

## Podcasts

Let's start with the tech/software/data related podcasts:

- The [Radical AI Podcast](https://www.radicalai.org/) regularly hosts people from the Responsible AI space. They really embrace the idea that Responsible (or Radical) AI is not possible without diversity of perspectives, fields, etc. and they have been very successful in attracting fantastic speakers (every episode I have listened to so far would have been an absolute highlight on any podcast). Plus, the hosts Dylan and Jess guide the interviews really well and give the guests a lot of space to express their thoughts (which is refreshing compared to other more host-centric podcasts).
- The [Microsoft Research Podcast](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/category/podcast/) is pretty interesting, because you otherwise only rarely get researchers talking about their journey on podcasts.
- [Packet Pushers - Datanauts](http://packetpushers.net/series/datanauts-podcast/) mostly focuses on infrastructure (cloud networking, storage, compute, etc.)
- [PodCtl](https://blog.openshift.com/tag/podctl/) covers the latest in the Kubernetes ecosystem.
- Various O'Reilly podcasts such as
    - [O'Reilly Data Show](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/oreilly-data-show-podcast)
    - [O'Reilly Programming](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/oreilly-programming-podcast)
    - [O'Reilly Radar](https://www.oreilly.com/topics/oreilly-radar-podcast) covers emerging technologies
- [Hanselminutes](https://hanselminutes.com/) by Scott Hanselman covers a very diverse set of topics related to technology.
- [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) has been growing in popularity. It's great if you want to get an idea of a field, say web development, or caching in distributed systems, you name it.

... and if we dare go beyond tech-focused podcasts, there's a ton of other interesting ones!

- In [Worklife](https://www.ted.com/read/ted-podcasts/worklife) Adam Grant talks about companies that make their workplace special in order to foster creativity, encourage criticism, and support a healthy work-life balance. Extremely thought-provoking, and definitely time well spent.
- [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com) by Steven J. Dubner is probably my favorite podcast on economics for exploring the "hidden side of everything". Remarkably, they manage to give all sides of any given discussion some time to represent their viewpoint. It is rare to finish an episode with the feeling that there's a clear divide between good and bad. Instead, Dubner accomplishes something fairly unique: he makes us think that maybe there's a little more to the topic than we thought...
- NPR's [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/) and its daily counterpart, [The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/567724614/the-indicator), shed some light on various (well-known and obscure) aspects of economics.
- [Conversations with Tyler](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler) has an extraordinary set of guests including Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Larry Summers, Raj Chetty, Jonathan Haidt.
- [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain) from NPR

## E-Learning

Whatever you need an introduction to, I'm sure you'll find it on [EdX](https://edx.org), [Coursera](https://edx.org), or [Udacity](https://edx.org). I've had some fantastic experiences with foundational courses on all of these platforms. High quality advanced courses are a lot harder to find. I usually look at more than 10-15 different ones before I'm happy with the course in terms of difficulty and structure.

Here are some classes I can personally recommend:

- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng (Stanford / Coursera) is the perfect course to start with ML if you know basic calculus, linear algebra and programming.
- [Introduction to Apache Spark](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+CS105x+1T2016/course/) by Anthony D. Joseph (UC Berkeley / Databricks / EdX) was a great way to start with Spark. Unfortunately, I didn't have the time for the two follow-up courses on Spark and they are now archived.
- [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes](https://www.udacity.com/course/scalable-microservices-with-kubernetes--ud615) by Carter Morgan and Kelsey Hightower (Google / Udacity) was a ton of fun. It teaches the very basics of Kubernetes, enough to deploy a very basic microservice. The good news is that the community is vibrant and you'll find answers for any problem once you've picked up the basics in this course.

As these platforms are looking to find a sustainable way to make money, it's become harder to find the right fit, since even just looking at materials requires paying a course fee. The models are different from platform to platform and sometimes even from course to course. Coursera has started to use monthly fees which is great if you have time, but bad if you're a part-time learner. EdX seems to remain free until you want a course certificate. Udacity has different models for every class. My favorite one so far was to pay a flat rate of $200, with a money back guarantee if you can't find a job after completion. That sounds like they're really confident their course is worth it. We'll see in which direction these platforms decide to evolve in the future. MOOCs are certainly not going away anytime soon.
