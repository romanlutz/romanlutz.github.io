# Design Patterns and Architecture

This first section focuses on articles about patterns...

- [Software Testing Anti-Patterns](http://blog.codepipes.com/testing/software-testing-antipatterns.html)

... while the second section is more about architecture, or at least thoughts about the structure of projects.

- [Why your next Open Source project may only be an interface](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-your-next-open-source-project-may-only-be-an-interface)
