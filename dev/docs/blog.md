      - As part of the Twitter migration, I moved over to Mastodon. You can find my account on at <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@romanlutz">@romanlutz@fosstodon.org</a>. While Twitter has provided <a href="https://twitterisgoinggreat.com/">plenty of excellent reasons to leave</a> I will add that having a decentralized social network is a fabulous idea to avoid being locked in in the future. If my current server operates in a way that does not mesh with my priorities and values I can always go elsewhere or start my own.

      - '<img src="../images/rai-dashboard-release.png" alt="RAI dashboard view of error analysis tool" width="100%" class="center">'
      - Earlier this month, the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai-for-business/building-ai-responsibly-from-research-to-practice/">Responsible AI dashboard was released</a>. As one of the key contributors on the engineering side I am really proud of this milestone. Of course, this is only where it really starts as we can now iterate on the first version. Make sure to <a href="https://responsibleaitoolbox.ai">try it</a> and leave some feedback!
      - The functionality is better captured by the blog and website, but something not mentioned there that I am really excited about is that we pulled this off in the open <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox">on GitHub</a>. That means anyone can see what goes into this, ask for features, or even contribute bugfixes.
      - Doing impactful work is awesome, but seeing the recognition in the entire company takes this to a whole different level. For example, I have seen tweets about this by <a href="https://twitter.com/kevin_scott/status/1468279751785828353">Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/erichorvitz/status/1468286435052572678?s=20">Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz</a>.

      - Naturally, the <a href="https://twitter.com/fairlearn">Fairlearn account</a> is a great way to hear all about updates related to the Fairlearn community.
      - I use <a href="https://twitter.com/romanlutz13">my own account</a> to post on topics related to open source and Responsible AI as well.
      - Finally, I've been curating a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1167589008119087105?s=20">list of people and organizations working on Responsible AI</a> for a while. As of today it contains 739 accounts with the caveat that people who aren't on Twitter can't be represented.

      - For a little while now I've been working on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/AI/our-approach-to-ai">Responsible AI at Microsoft</a>. Now that our tools are announced with <a href="https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/81147">Sarah Bird's talk at Ignite</a> I can finally point to our tools openly. A lot of my time over the past months went into <a href="https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn">fairlearn</a>, our open source toolkit for fairness assessment and unfairness mitigation. We just released v0.3.0, so there's a lot more to come in the next months. I will be in Vancouver for NeurIPS in December to demo our tools around fairness and interpretability. Talk to me if you will be there!
      - '<img src="../images/abstraction-fairml.PNG" alt="Abstraction in Fairness-aware Machine Learning" width="100%" class="center">'
      - Since fairness is tricky to get right we have been meeting bi-weekly as a Responsible AI reading group. Today I had the honor to lead the discussion about <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3265913">"Fairness and Abstraction in Sociotechnical Systems"</a> by Andrew D. Selbst, danah boyd, Sorelle A. Friedler, Suresh Venkatasubramanian, and Janet Vertesi. I highly encourage everyone to read this paper to avoid the mentioned abstraction traps when building machine learning systems. Maybe this should be part of a mandatory checklist before releasing models... If you're interested in my slides (which were inspired by the authors') you may download them <a href="https://github.com/romanlutz/romanlutz.github.io/blob/gh-pages/other/FairnessAndAbstractionInSociotechnicalSystems.pdf">here</a>.

While it was not my first ML course, it was definitely a great refresher. I absolutely recommend this class to beginners who want to get started. A potential drawback of this class is that it uses Octave for the programming assignments. While I had some prior exposure to Matlab, most people would probably prefer Python or R. Andrew Ng has a very pleasant teaching style and explains the math thoroughly where possible.'

It is a short and funny introduction and ideal if you are trying to get started with Kubernetes. It is important to remember that Kubernetes is simply a tool that can be used to scale a microservices architecture, and it us not the only one. Potentially the most useful resource of the whole class was <a href="https://www.microservices.com/">www.microservices.com</a>. Check it out! As as sidenote, I absolutely recommend listening to <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com">Software Engineering Daily</a> if you are curious about Microservices. A number of guests on SE Daily have shared their perspective on microservices, including Neal Ford, Rafi Schloming, Richard Li, Austin Gunter, and Matt Klein, to name a few.'

      content:
        - 'Yesterday I participated in the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/new-england-machine-learning-hackathon-hacking-bias-in-ml-tickets-32951771636?aff=NEML">Hacking Bias in ML</a> workshop at Microsoft`s New England Research and Development Center (full disclosure: I work there as well). Bias is natural to Machine Learning models, of course. Generally speaking, the idea is always to find certain properties of the provided data that indicate belonging to a specific group or class. For example, we might find that success in European soccer is strongly correlated with a team`s budget. The budget will therefore serve as an important feature for our success prediction model. But what if the environment changes? Say, hypothetically, that the European soccer leagues decide to enforce a salary cap similar to American sports leagues (note: This is simply a hypothetical scenario and does not reflect the author`s opinion). Using the same model suddenly makes no sense anymore, we have to adjust. A somewhat similar, albeit much more consequential change has happened in our society as well. Discrimination based on gender, race, and many other traits is not acceptable. While the law slowly adapts to equality and tolerance, ML models are still trained with the same old data that reflects these biases. Since there is no actual magic in the models, they will represent that bias in the results they provide. This poses the danger of carrying these models/views/biases into the future, possibly without realizing that we are subconsciously biased. My group specifically looked at gender bias in texts, and since explaining word embeddings in a short post is a tall order, let`s just say it`s a way of mapping words to vectors in a multi-dimensional space whose relative locations represent certain relationships. With that we can find that some words are generally more used in connection with men ("smart"), some more with women ("lovely"). You can play around with the tool resulting from the workshop <a href="https://mdml.github.io/hacking-bias-in-word-choice/#">here</a>. While this is only a little prototype, let`s all try to work on our subconscious biases, shall we?'

      content:
        - '<img src="../images/rise_of_quantified_athlete.jpeg" alt="Rise of Quantified Athlete main panel" width="100%" class="center">'
        - 'I attended <a href="https://i-lab.harvard.edu/event/quantified-athlete/">"Rise of the Quantified Athlete"</a> at the <a href="https://i-lab.harvard.edu">Harvard innovation Labs</a> recently, a delightful unconference and discussion forum on the future of quantifiable performance in sports. While the primary focus was on the "Quantified Athlete" seemingly directed towards wearable sensors and fitness data, I can see this going much further than just individual stats. One key statement by Matt Hasselbeck (former QB - Colts, Titans, Seahawks, Packers, and 3-time Pro Bowler) in the forum`s Overtime panel highlights exactly this. Even if we have all this data, "So what?". Gathering all kinds of data is not the purpose, it`s about finding useful nuggets and actionable conclusions. Especially from the perspective of the Quarterback, individual nuances are less important when you have to keep track of 21 players on the field. If technology can help uncover patterns or recommend how to exploit them, it might become a critical part of a team`s preparation. Ryan Fitpatrick (QB, Jets, Texans, Titans, Bills, Bengals, Rams) mentioned that in addition to game film, he regularly uses virtual reality to explore what`s happening during plays in a 3-dimensional VR environment. As exciting as this sounds, I was surprised to hear that in terms of finding tendencies there`s little or no Advanced Statistics or Machine Learning being used.'
        - "Hasselbeck, Fitzpatrick and Zak DeOssie (LS, New York Giants, two-time Superbowl winner) hung around after the panel to interact with students, entrepreneurs and interested folks like me. After making some bad experiences in that respect with soccer players in Germany (yes, I haven't forgotten, Franz Beckenbauer!), it was unreal to talk to a starting NFL QB and actually answer his questions concerning what I'm working on."
        - "I'd like to note an interesting answer from Matt Hasselbeck on what he would love to get from technology. Anything that helps players rest. During practice and games there's a ton of coaches and assistants telling players what to do, but once that's over, they are more or less left to themselves without being given recommendations on how to optimize resting. Interesting point! And it sounds like a relatively simple one to solve, too."
        - "The panel was largely focused on data ownership/privacy vs. getting the most out of the data. Unsurprisingly, some athletes such as Paul Rabil (Lacrosse, Team USA) and Meghan Duggan (Hockey, Captain Team USA) seemed rather enthusiastic about having data available to help them optimize their habits, get the most out of their bodies, and maybe even having longer careers due to more sustainable exercise and injury avoidance. In contrast, Fitpatrick, Hasselbeck and Shawn Springs (former CB, Seahawks, Redskins, Patriots) pointed out potential issues for players beyond their peak. As an example, take an accomplished receiver slowing down towards the end of his career. With sensors, coaches can now monitor and recognize this, leading to potential loss of leverage in contract negotiations or even being cut from the roster. This is obviously a crucial point in this evolution of the game, and we are certain to hear how NFLPA and NFL settle on this matter."

      content:
        - I've recently started the learning path "The Road to Tensorflow" on Safari Books Online. You can find it <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-path-the/9781787123700/">here</a>. It's essentially a series of video tutorials from Packt Publishing. They start with Python and sklearn, in order to prepare for Deep Learning in the second half of the learning path. For that, they use Theano and later Tensorflow. I really liked that they provide the code so you can always run it yourself as well and play around with parameters. If you want to avoid heating your apartment with your laptop (that's what my old machine used to do, almost as loud as a vaccuum cleaner...) then try setting up a VM in the cloud with Docker and Tensorflow. I used Lee Stott's step by step description on how to do that with Azure. You can find it <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2016/09/26/tensorflow-on-docker-with-microsoft-azure/">here</a>. Have fun!

The idea is that some problems are difficult to solve with basic local search algorithms because of a tightly constrained search space. Small changes to a solution will rarely bring improvements. As a consequence, LNS and ALNS change larger parts based on different heuristics."
