# Tech blogs

Let's start with some interesting websites to read or check regularly if you're interested in Computer Science:

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)
- [Code Without Rules](https://codewithoutrules.com)
- [Medium](https://medium.com)
- [OpenSource.com](http://opensource.com/)

Tech company blogs have high quality standards, so it's worth checking them every so often.

- [Lyft Engineering Blog](https://eng.lyft.com)
- [Uber Engineering Blog](https://eng.uber.com)
- [Netflix Tech Blog](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog)
- [AirBnB Engineering and Data Science](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering)
- [Azure Machine Learning Blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/tag/azure-machine-learning/)
- [Google Research Blog](https://research.googleblog.com)
- [Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/)
- I found [this nice article](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/geospatial-analysis-python-geojson-geopandas.html) about geospatial analysis on the Twilio blog.
- [Hakka Labs](https://www.hakkalabs.co/) is a community for Data Engineers.
- [DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io) has lots of broadly data science related articles, e.g. [this one](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/making-538-plots/) on data visualization.

At some point you'll want to set up your own webpage. In any case, a simple tool to get started is by hosting it through [GitHub Pages](http://romantsegelskyi.github.io/blog/2015/07/26/personal-page-blog/). I've had a great experience with it, even though I haven't used a lot of its functionalities since I brought my own template. I created a few backgrounds using [cool-backgrounds.io](https://coolbackgrounds.io/), some of which are featured on this webpage.
