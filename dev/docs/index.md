With so many truly difficult problems to tackle, it is fantastic to see all the ideas people came up with. Big shoutout to MIT for organizing this, Microsoft for the venue (and encouraging me to go!), and Amazon for sending two inspiring mentors for my team all the way from Seattle! Thanks also to my team for creating a creative environment where everybody could express their ideas. I learned a ton from all of you, and winning 3rd prize tops it all off. I hope everybody takes some time to think about Machine Learning Bias. With ML becoming increasingly prevalent, it is more important than ever to take bias into account.'

An application of this is the following: by plugging in various play options one could determine the best play for a given situation in real time. While the outcome of a play can be described in many ways we had the most promising results with a newly defined measure that we call "progress". We see this work as a first step to include predictive analysis into NFL playcalling.

          - '<img src="../images/alns.png" alt="Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search - Destory and Repair" width="50%" class="center"><br>The goal of my Bachelor`s thesis was to implement the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic and possibly come up with improvements. ALNS was described first by S. Ropke and D. Pisinger and is based on P. Shaw`s Large Neighborhood Search. The idea is that some problems are difficult to solve with basic local search algorithms because of a tightly constrained search space. Small changes to a solution will rarely bring improvements. As a consequence, LNS and ALNS change larger parts based on different heuristics. For this thesis, I was awarded the innoWake Award 2015. <a href="http://www.innowake.com">innoWake</a> was a software modernization company based in Austin, TX and had a number of branch offices including one in Germany. They have since been acquired by Deloitte.'
