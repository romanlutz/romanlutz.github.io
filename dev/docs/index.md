      description: Our new paper is on ArXiv! Titled <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/23-0389.html">A Framework for Automated Measurement of Responsible AI Harms in Generative AI Applications</a>, it talks about some of the ways we have been evaluating LLMs. This was a joint effort of many teams at Microsoft and Microsoft Research. I am particularly happy with the emphasis on input from domain experts. This is merely a tool to help speed up evaluations, but the actual decisions about mitigations and whether a system is deployed remains (and should remain) with humans.

      description: The new <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v24/23-0389.html">Fairlearn paper</a> is now in the Journal for Machine Learning Research (Open Source Software section)! It captures our change from being a project under Microsoft governance to being a true open source project with open governance. As of today, half the maintainers are employed by Microsoft (including myself). Also, the focus of the project has shifted significantly since the original whitepaper. Back then, the Python toolkit was the main focus whereas now the educational materials are being prioritized. This aims to acknowledge the sociotechnical nature of fairness.

As one of the key contributors on the engineering side I am really proud of this milestone. Of course, this is only where it really starts as we can now iterate on the first version. Make sure to <a href="https://responsibleaitoolbox.ai">try it</a> and leave some feedback! The functionality is better captured by the blog and website, but something not mentioned there that I am really excited about is that we pulled this off in the open <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/responsible-ai-toolbox">on GitHub</a>. That means anyone can see what goes into this, ask for features, or even contribute bugfixes. Doing impactful work is awesome, but seeing the recognition in the entire company takes this to a whole different level. For example, I have seen tweets about this by <a href="https://twitter.com/kevin_scott/status/1468279751785828353">Microsoft

Today I had the honor to lead the discussion about <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3265913">"Fairness and Abstraction in Sociotechnical Systems"</a> by Andrew D. Selbst, danah boyd, Sorelle A. Friedler, Suresh Venkatasubramanian, and Janet Vertesi. I highly encourage everyone to read this paper to avoid the mentioned abstraction traps when building machine learning systems. Maybe this should be part of a mandatory checklist before releasing models...

      description: Participating at <a href="http://www.mitbreakingthemold.com/challenges/">MIT`s Breaking the Mold Hackathon for Inclusion</a> was truly a blessing. With so many truly difficult problems to tackle, it is fantastic to see all the ideas people came up with. Big shoutout to MIT for organizing this, Microsoft for the venue (and encouraging me to go!), and Amazon for sending two inspiring mentors for my team all the way from Seattle! Thanks also to my team for creating a creative environment where everybody could express their ideas. I learned a ton from all of you, and winning 3rd prize tops it all off. I hope everybody takes some time to think about Machine Learning Bias. With ML becoming increasingly prevalent, it is more important than ever to take bias into account.

      description: 'Based on NFL game data we try to predict the outcome of a play in multiple different ways including Decision and Classification Trees, Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines and Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks. An application of this is the following: by plugging in various play options one could determine the best play for a given situation in real time. While the outcome of a play can be described in many ways we had the most promising results with a newly defined measure that we call "progress". We see this work as a first step to include predictive analysis into NFL playcalling.

Users have many tools at their disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users.

      imageAlt: Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search - Destroy and Repair
      description: The goal of my Bachelor`s thesis was to implement the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic and possibly come up with improvements. ALNS was described first by S. Ropke and D. Pisinger and is based on P. Shaw`s Large Neighborhood Search. The idea is that some problems are difficult to solve with basic local search algorithms because of a tightly constrained search space. Small changes to a solution will rarely bring improvements. As a consequence, LNS and ALNS change larger parts based on different heuristics. For this thesis, I received the innoWake Award 2015. <a href="http://www.innowake.com">innoWake</a> was a software modernization company based in Austin, TX and had a number of branch offices including one in Germany. They have since been acquired by Deloitte.

      description: As a teaching assistant for Prof. Jacobo Toran, Gunnar Völkel and Dominikus Krüger, I explained the solutions to weekly assignments to a group of 20 students whose work I also graded. In addition to that, I often gave a review of the material presented in class. It made me very happy to see the attendance rate constantly high throughout the semester and especially the positive feedback at the end of the course.

      description: As part of a seminar at Uni Ulm, I implemented and evaluated the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) meta-heuristic by D. Karaboga. ABC is a nature-inspired metaheuristic that projects the foraging behavior of bees on an algorithm in order to solve optimization problems. The idea behind such approaches is that many kinds of behavior of animals, bacteria etc. in nature have adapted to their specific environment due to evolution — in a way, an optimization process has taken place.

      description: Under the guidance of Christian Spann, I read up on different ways to implement concurrent programs in Java, from Threads, Runnables and Executors to thread-safe versions of data structures. Finally, I presented the different approaches and techniques in a seminar talk.
