# Art

## AI Art

I'm personally interested in AI-generated Art because it empowers everyone to create beautiful paintings and innovate regardless of how skilled they are at what we would traditionally call art (e.g., painting). Even more so, you can use your own photos or prompts to create unique pieces that mean something to you, so it's not just the billionth photo of the Golden Gate Bridge, but maybe it's your photo of the Golden Gate Bridge as if it was painted by Picasso! 

Some resources I recommend on this topic are below:

- [DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) by OpenAI
- [From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion](https://www.fast.ai/posts/part2-2022.html) course by Jeremy Howard, recordings should be available sometime in 2023.
- [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org)
- [Generative Design](https://canvas.ucsc.edu/courses/25531) course by Adam Smith at UCSC
- [DeOldify](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify/blob/master/README.md)
- [16 Artists using ML to transform digital art](https://kadenze.medium.com/16-artists-using-machine-learning-to-transform-digital-art-5aa8e03e879d)

As this is a fairly new topic, most rules and laws will probably be set in the future. It is always worth considering some of the issues a new tool might introduce. For AI art this includes concerns about using existing art for AI training without crediting or compensating the artists.
