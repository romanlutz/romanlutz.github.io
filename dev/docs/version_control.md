# Version Control

Quite possibly the most widely used and at the same time least acknowledged technology, version control has saved me from myself more times than I can count. I use Git on a daily basis and still marvel at the capabilities. There's countless ways of learning it, like this [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775). Git is the most popular system, and if you get frustrated initially, maybe this will help:

And finally a few articles and opinions about git:

- [Git Magic](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~blynn/gitmagic/) is an accessible page explaining how git works in an engaging manner.
- [Why you should stop using git rebase](https://blogg.bekk.no/why-you-should-stop-using-git-rebase-5552bee4fed1)
- [Anatomy of a perfect pull request](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/anatomy-perfect-pull-request) is a great resource on how to do pull requests the right way. I get back to this every so often to remind myself of the best practices.

Perhaps not directly related to version control for day-to-day development, but I highly recommend proper [semantic versioning](https://slides.com/deniseyu/semantic-versioning#/
) when releasing software.
