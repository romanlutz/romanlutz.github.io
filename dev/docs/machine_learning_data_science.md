# Machine Learning & Data Science

Our world is full of Machine Learning and Data Science, so it's best to stay informed and use it for good. I've encountered a ton of nice learning resources, articles or simply fascinating inventions directly or indirectly related to ML & DS, that are listed below. Keep in mind, ML is at the intersection of Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Computer Science.

- An [article](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/06/22/ways-to-think-about-machine-learning-8nefy) by Ben Evans about what ML is and is not (at this point).
- [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman (all Stanford) is a great introductory book on the foundational concepts. I cannot recommend this book enough.
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by Michael Nielsen (Y Combinator) is a free online book. On many occasions I've landed on this page to get a better understanding about neural networks, and it's helped almost always.
- [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng (Stanford / Coursera) is the perfect course to start with ML if you know basic calculus, linear algebra and programming.
- [TensorFlow World Resources](http://tensorflow-world-resources.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a collection of resources curated by Amirsina Torfi.

## Responsible AI

To me, Responsible AI (RAI) is one of the defining (research) areas of our time with the potential to have a positive impact on people's lives. This is includes topics like fairness, interpretability & explainability, differential privacy, and several related ones. Below are some of the best resources I've come across:

- [Fairness and Machine Learning](https://fairmlbook.org/) by Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt, and Arvind Narayanan is currently still a work in progress, but what I've seen from it seemed extremely promising.
- [Algorithmic Fairness](https://algorithmicfairness.wordpress.com/) is a blog with lots of articles about the topic by Suresh Venkatasubramanian.
- [Moritz Hardt's class website for Fairness in Machine Learning](https://fairmlclass.github.io/) has a great collection of material.
- In [Black Mirror, Light Mirror: Teaching Technology Ethics Through Speculation](https://howwegettonext.com/the-black-mirror-writers-room-teaching-technology-ethics-through-speculation-f1a9e2deccf4), [Casey Fiesler](https://caseyfiesler.com/about/) walks through some thought-provoking ways of thinking about tech ethics including the "Black Mirror Writers' Room". 
- The [AI Ethics Weekly newsletter](https://lighthouse3.com/newsletter/) curated by Lighthouse3 keeps you up-to-date on the latest RAI jobs, news, and articles by RAI experts.
- The [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](https://montrealethics.ai) is building a community of people in AI Ethics through events, articles, and research. For a good overview, I highly recommend their newsletter.

## Datasets

## ML applied to Natural Language Processing

- [Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)
- [Understanding Word Vectors](https://gist.github.com/aparrish/2f562e3737544cf29aaf1af30362f469)
- [Spacy](https://spacy.io)

## Visualization

- [Facets](https://github.com/PAIR-code/facets?utm_source=mybridge&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=read_more)
- [Feature Visualization](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/)

## Machine Learning in the browser

[DeepLearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org/)

## Machine Learning Art

I'm personally interested in Machine Learning Art because it allows everyone to create beautiful paintings regardless of how skilled they are at painting. Even more so, you can use your own photos to create unique pieces that mean something to you, so it's not just the billionth photo of the Golden Gate Bridge, but it's your photo of the Golden Gate Bridge as if it was painted by Picasso! Some resources I recommend on this topic are below:

- [Interactive Image Generation with GANs](https://github.com/junyanz/iGAN)
- [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/CycleGAN?imm_mid=0f167c&cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_ai_20170508), [CycleGAN and Pix2Pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix?utm_source=mybridge&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=read_more)
- [Style2Paints](https://github.com/lllyasviel/style2paints)
- [Fast Style Transfer in TensorFlow](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer)
- [Deep Photo Style Transfer](https://github.com/luanfujun/deep-photo-styletransfer)
- [Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org)
- This one is not quite art, but close enough... [Background Removal with Deep Learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/background-removal-with-deep-learning-c4f2104b3157)
- [Deep Image Prior](https://dmitryulyanov.github.io/deep_image_prior) helps to improve pictures through denoising and artifact removal.
- [Professional Level Photographs with Deep Learning](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/07/using-deep-learning-to-create.html)

## Finding Research Papers

Whether you're at university or just generally interested in research, in most cases you won't know exactly what you're looking for. Two great websites to get started are [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) and [Semantic Scholar](https://semanticscholar.org). They essentially built search for research papers/journals/books/etc. Semantic Scholar offers a few features Google Scholar doesn't have, while Google Scholar seems to have more data overall at least in my experience.

- [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org) is an archive for articles, usually used for sharing ideas that will later get submitted as papers to conferences. With [ArXiv Vanity](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/), you can read the papers rendered in the browser as opposed to the PDF format.
- [Distill](https://distill.pub/about/) is aiming at making research "clear, dynamic and vivid". It is a super-interesting effort that shows that research does not have to be constrained by a printable A4 sized PDF format. Maybe all research can be published like this someday.
