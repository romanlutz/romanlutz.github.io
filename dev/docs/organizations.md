# Organizations

The products built by any engineering organization typically reflect the organization structure and health. In my opinion, nothing can be as conducive to good work as a positive work climate in an organization where people feel empowered. At the same time, setting up an organization like that can be tricky, so I have been getting increasingly interested in various factors that influence our organizations, and how to steer them in the right direction. Below are some interesting resources I have come across, and also thought-provoking ideas that people may want to consider.


- [An Elegant Puzzle - Systems of Engineering Management](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186) by [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/about/)
- Paul Graham's [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) captures the effect of meetings on an engineer's day at work. There's certainly different kinds of roles and various kinds of meetings, but the general idea is still valid: engineers need large continuous chunks of time to get things done.
- [Three-day no-meeting schedule for engineers](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/three-day-no-meeting-schedule-for-engineers-fca9f857a567)
- [Get happy developers to do what you want](https://sdtimes.com/softwaredev/get-happy-developers-to-do-what-you-want/) by Jessica Kerr talks about how removing friction is the right way to get people to do things, instead of settings rules or (potentially misguided) incentives.
