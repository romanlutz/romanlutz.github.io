# User interfaces and user experience

A lot of people use UI and UX interchangeably for some reason when referring to visual UIs. Even a CLI or SDK or voice-based communication provide some kind of UX, of course. I will just list some generally useful links on the topic that I have come across over the years. In the future this may get more structured. Working with UX designers is truly one of the highlights of my career so far. There is so much to learn from their perspectives, and making the effort will pay off tenfold in the quality of whatever you are building.
