Roman Lutz's website

## Development process

To try it out locally run the following command from the `dev` directory and check the page in your browser

```
mkdocs serve
```

To build the site after making changes locally, run

```
mkdocs build
```

and subsequently copy the files from the newly generated `dev/site` directory into the root directory (replacing the existing ones). Go ahead and commit those to see it reflected in the actual webpage.
