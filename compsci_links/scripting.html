        <p>Arguably one of the most important survival skills of any engineer, at least if you like getting things done fast. I used to get annoyed a lot that my newly learnt Bash skills were worthless in Windows and my Powershell scripts wouldn't run on Linux/Unix [unless you come up with workarounds]. Python has really impressed me due to its ability to run on both, and is definitely a great choice for scripting. I learnt Python on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codecademy</a> a while back, but it seems like it's not free anymore. Fortunately, Python is one of the most widely used languages and you'll find tons of introductions and help with issues on the web.</p>
