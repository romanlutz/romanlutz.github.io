            Whether you're at university or just generally interested in research, in most cases you won't know exactly what you're looking for. Two great websites to get started are <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://semanticscholar.org">Semantic Scholar</a>. They essentially built search for research papers/journals/books/etc. Semantic Scholar offers a few features Google Scholar doesn't have, while Google Scholar seems to have more data overall at least in my experience.
            <a href="https://arxiv.org">ArXiv</a> is an archive for articles, usually used for sharing ideas that will later get submitted as papers to conferences. With <a href="https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/">ArXiv Vanity</a>, you can read the papers rendered in the browser as opposed to the PDF format.

            <a href="https://distill.pub/about/">Distill</a> is aiming at making research "clear, dynamic and vivid". It is a super-interesting effort that shows that research does not have to be constrained by a printable A4 sized PDF format. Maybe all research can be published like this someday.
