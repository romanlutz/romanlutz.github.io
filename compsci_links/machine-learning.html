        <p>Our world is full of Machine Learning and Data Science, so it's best to stay informed and use it for good. I've encountered a ton of nice learning resources, articles or simply fascinating inventions directly or indirectly related to ML & DS, that are listed below. Keep in mind, ML is at the intersection of Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Computer Science.</p>

                An <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2018/06/22/ways-to-think-about-machine-learning-8nefy">article</a> by Ben Evans about what ML is and is not (at this point).

                <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a> by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman (all Stanford) is a great introductory book on the foundational concepts. I cannot recommend this book enough.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> by Michael Nielsen (Y Combinator) is a free online book. On many occasions I've landed on this page to get a better understanding about neural networks, and it's helped almost always.

                <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a> by Andrew Ng (Stanford / Coursera) is the perfect course to start with ML if you know basic calculus, linear algebra and programming.

                I'm personally interested in Machine Learning Art because it allows everyone to create beautiful paintings regardless of how skilled they are at painting. Even more so, you can use your own photos to create unique pieces that mean something to you, so it's not just the billionth photo of the Golden Gate Bridge, but it's your photo of the Golden Gate Bridge as if it was painted by Picasso! Some resources I recommend on this topic are below:
