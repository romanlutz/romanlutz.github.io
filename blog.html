					</header>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>I've recently started the learning path "The Road to Tensorflow" on Safari Books Online. You can find it <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-path-the/9781787123700/">here</a>. It's essentially a series of video tutorials from Packt Publishing. They start with Python and sklearn, in order to prepare for Deep Learning in the second half of the learning path. For that, they use Theano and later Tensorflow. I really liked that they provide the code so you can always run it yourself as well and play around with parameters. If you want to avoid heating your apartment with your laptop (that's what my old machine used to do, almost as loud as a vaccuum cleaner...) then try setting up a VM in the cloud with Docker and Tensorflow. I used the Lee Stott's step by step description on how to do that with Azure. You can find it <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2016/09/26/tensorflow-on-docker-with-microsoft-azure/">here</a>. Have fun!

					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>I've moved my website from wix.com to github.com and used that as an opportunity to overhaul the whole website. Wix is great if you want a page up and running. As soon as you want specific formatting by tweaking some CSS or Javascript, though, you quickly reach Wix's limits. I've always seen this as an interesting hobby, and being able to take any template and adjust it to my wishes is simply great. Kudos to Sergey Pozhilov from gettemplate.com for providing that with Creative Commons Attribution license. More on that at <a href="http://www.gettemplate.com/info/initio/">gettemplate.com</a>. This page is now on GitHub Pages since that offers a number of advantages: I don't have to bother with ads from the company hosting it. The page is associated with my GitHub repository, and I can clearly see changes I've made, line by line.</p>

						<p>Based on NFL game data we try to predict the outcome of a play in multiple different ways including Decision and Classification Trees, Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machines and Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks. An application of this is the following: by plugging in various play options one could determine the best play for a given situation in real time. While the outcome of a play can be described in many ways we had the most promising results with a newly defined measure that we call "progress". We see this work as a first step to include predictive analysis into NFL playcalling. See the full paper at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00574">arxiv.org/abs/1601.00574</a>; in collaboration with Brendan Teich and Valentin Kassarnig.

						<p>The ubiquity of professional sports and specifically the NFL have lead to an increase in popularity for Fantasy Football. Users have many tools at their disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides and discusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks with relatively limited data.

						<p>There are several NSF-funded Future Internet Architecture research projects in the US. Their focus is mostly on improving the scalability and efficiency. I am interested in how the different approaches affect (or do not affect) the privacy of users in comparison to the current Internet. My focus will be on research about the feasibility of censorship circumvention. As an example, I picked Content-oriented Networking.

					<div class="entry-content">
						<p><img src="assets/images/alns.png" alt="Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search - Destory and Repair" width="100%"></p>
						<p>The goal of my Bachelor's thesis was to implement the Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic and possibly come up with improvements. ALNS was described first by S. Ropke and D. Pisinger and is based on P. Shaw's Large Neighborhood Search. The idea is that some problems are difficult to solve with basic local search algorithms because of a tightly constrained search space. Small changes to a solution will rarely bring improvements. As a consequence, LNS and ALNS change larger parts based on different heuristics.
						</p>
						<p>For this thesis I was awarded the innoWake Award 2015. <a href="http://www.innowake.com">innoWake</a> is a software modernization company based in Austin, TX and has a number of branch offices including one in Germany. Their <a href="http://www.ride-the-wake.de/lernen/">German webpage</a> describes the award itself.</p>

						<p>For two semesters I worked on a Software Engineering project with the aim of developing a University Course Registration Platform that allows the distribution of course participants into groups based on different criteria. The project involved all phases of a typical software project, from analysis and design to the actual implementation. On top of being a regular team member, it was my role as the team manager to both coordinate and plan for the team and communicate with the customer. In the end, the system was delivered on time with all necessary and a few additional features to the satisfaction of the customer. In collaboration with Tobias Baumann, David Köhler and Max Schnitzlein.</p>

						<p>As a teaching assistant for Prof. Jacobo Toran, Gunnar V&#246;lkel and Dominikus Kr&#252;ger, I explained the solutions to weekly assignments to a group of 20 students whose work I also graded. In addition to that, I often gave a review of the material presented in class. It made me very happy to see the attendance rate constantly high throughout the semester and especially the positive feedback at the end of the course.

						<p>We can observe many kinds of behavior of animals, bacteria etc. in nature where an adaption to the specific environment has taken place due to evolution. In a way, an optimization process has taken place. This idea is the basis for so-called nature-inspired metaheuristics. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) meta-heuristic by D. Karaboga is such a nature-inspired metaheuristic. It projects the foraging behavior of bees on an algorithm in order to solve optimization problems.
